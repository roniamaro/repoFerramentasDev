  200 — OK: This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual meaning of the response depends on the request method used:
    GET: Resource obtained and is in the message body
    HEAD: Headers are included in the response
    POST or PUT: Resource describing the result of the action sent is in the message body
    TRACE: Message body contains the request message as received by the server
    201 — Created: The request succeeded and a new resource was created. This is usually the response after POST or PUT requests. 

  202 — Accepted: The request was accepted but is still in progress. It’s used for cases where another server handles the request or for batch processing. 

  204 — No Content: The request was successfully processed, but there is no content. The headers may be useful. 

  400 — Bad Request: The server can’t or won’t process the request due to a client error. For example, invalid request message framing, deceptive request routing, size too large, etc.

  401 — Unauthorized: The user doesn’t have valid authentication credentials to get the requested resource.

  404 — Not Found: The server can’t find the requested resource, and no redirection has been set. 404 errors can harm your SEO efforts.

  408 — Request Timeout: The server timed out waiting because the client didn’t produce a request within the allotted time.

  413 — Payload Too Large: The client’s request is larger than the server’s defined limits, and the server refuses to process it.

  500 — Internal Server Error: The server has encountered an unexpected error and cannot complete the request.
